Relevant research has been standing out in the computing community aiming to develop computational models capable of predicting the occurrence of crimes, analyzing contexts of crimes, extracting profiles of individuals linked to crimes, and analyzing crimes according to time. This, due to the social impact and also the very complex nature of the data, thus showing itself as an interesting computational challenge. This research presents a computational model for the prediction of homicide crimes, based on multidimensional temporal data of crimes registered in the city of Belém - Pará, Brazil. Statistical tests were performed with 8 different classification methods, both Random Forest and SVM presented best results, AUC ~ 0.8.
